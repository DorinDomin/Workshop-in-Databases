Final project for class.
This app displays information about the corona virus in countries around the world, depending on a specific date.
This app includes statistical data analysis, and provides information
regarding the rate of virus progression relative to other countries.

#### Databases we used:
We used two databases that contain data about the virus, sorted by date and country.
- The first database contains for each date the morbidity data of about 200 countries.
  -  https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data 
- The second database contains accompanying data on the state of educational institutions in the country, including information between March and mid-November (2020).
  -  https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse

###### Basic information analysis:
- removing unnecessary columns.
- suitable date format.
- characters restriction.
- Removing irrelevant information.

##### We also included an [Hebrew report](https://github.com/DorinDomin/Workshop-in-Databases/blob/84dd8dbdffae96c447b39d7b7f1111db7042e13a/Software%20Document%20(general).pdf)
